Refine the following video captions based on global context and coherence. 

Ensure the revised captions are clear and contextual.

Each captions is first generated by VideoLlama from the corresponding clip with the prompt: 
  "prompt": "{{Prompt}}"

And here is the VideoLlama captioning result:
  "results": {{Result}}

Then, based on the results, we ask GPT4 to generate some prompt to ask VideoLlama for more information once the given VideoLlama's caption is not coherence with the context or against the common sense. 

GPT4 has found out the corresponding id of the clip, and give a new prompt to VideoLlama to gain more information. The list of id, list of new prompt, and a list of new VideoLlama captioning result are respectively 
{
  "id" : "{{Id2}}"
  "prompt2": "{{Prompt2}}"
  "results2": "{{Result2}}"

}

Based on the first captioning results for all id and the second captioning results for some ids. Please refine the caption for the id 40845 to 40918. 

Your response should be in JSON and the response template is:

{
  id: {
    "caption": caption,
  }
}
